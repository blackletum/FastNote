## Features
- Fully self-contained EXE 
- Custom icon that shows in the window and About dialog (fancy!)
- Simple, familiar interface, similar to old Windows Notepad
- Designed for quick notes without clutter
- In my very scientific testing (trust me!), the utility uses 7 times less ram than modern notepad on average
- No AI or Microsoft pestering!
